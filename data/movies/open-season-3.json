The comedy begins when Boog\u2019s pals choose their family obligations over the annual guy\u2019s trip, and a disappointed Boog decides to take a trip of his own, which leads him right into the middle of a circus ring\u2026literally. When he switches places with a devious look-a-like circus grizzly and falls for an alluring Russian troupe member, he\u2019ll come to realize that maybe you don\u2019t have to choose between family and friendship after all.",

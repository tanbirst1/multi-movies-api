    "synopsis": "Leonard Shelby is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife\u2019s killer, however, is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of short-term memory loss. Although he can recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he\u2019s going, or why."

So, when he and his fellow assassins kidnap the daughter of an electronics mogul, it\u2019s naturally Melvin who takes the fall when their prime score turns sour. That\u2019s because the girl is the goddaughter of the gang\u2019s ruthless crime boss. But, even while dodging bullets, Melvin has to keep his real job secret from his unsuspecting fianc\u00e9e, Pam."

    "synopsis": "Clear the runway for Derek Zoolander, VH1\u2019s three-time male model of the year. His face falls when hippie-chic Hansel scooters in to steal this year\u2019s award. The evil fashion guru Mugatu seizes the opportunity to turn Derek into a killing machine. It\u2019s a well-designed conspiracy and only with the help of Hansel and a few well-chosen accessories like Matilda can Derek make the world safe for male models everywhere."

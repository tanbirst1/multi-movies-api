Finally, they give in, and surrender, only to find themselves imprisoned in a new, more sophisticated fortress prison in outer space. But Brennick\u2019s not a man to give in easily, and with a 10 year old son waiting for him back on earth, he\u2019s going to pack some serious assault on the evil corporation."

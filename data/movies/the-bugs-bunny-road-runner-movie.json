Among the 11 shorts shown in their entirety are the classics \u201cRobin Hood Daffy,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Opera, Doc?,\u201d \u201cBully for Bugs,\u201d and \u201cDuck Amuck\u201d. The Bugs Bunny Road Runner Movie provides a showcase not only for Jones\u2019s razor-sharp timing, but for the work of his exceptional crew, which included designer Maurice Noble, writer Mike Maltese, composers Carl Stalling and Milt Franklyn, and voice actor Mel Blanc.",

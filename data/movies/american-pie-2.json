    "synopsis": "After a year apart \u2013 attending different schools, meeting different people \u2013 the guys rent a beach house and vow to make this the best summer ever. As it turns out, whether that will happen or not has a lot to do with the girls. Between the wild parties, outrageous revelations and yes, a trip to band camp, they discover that times change and people change, but in the end, it\u2019s all about sticking together."

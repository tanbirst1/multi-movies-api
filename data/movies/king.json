Years later, while on a trip to Uttaranchal, despite of warnings from a Pandit, he gets killed by a female assassin, but his family is informed that he is missing. Shortly thereafter, Gyaneshwar Kale and his sister, Sravani/Shivani, will inform the family that Raja is still alive but is handicapped and suffers from memory loss. The family is overjoyed but are not aware that Raja is actually a hoodlum/extortionist known as Bottu Seenu/Raghu Rokda.",

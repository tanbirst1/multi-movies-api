    "synopsis": "A group of beavers ask Dr. Dolittle to save their habitat from loggers. The only hope is to get the forest preserved because it\u2019s the home of a protected bear, but there\u2019s a problem: the bear\u2019s the only bear in the forest, so she can\u2019t reproduce. Undaunted, Dolittle persuades a circus bear to help out, but he has to teach him not just the ways of the wild, but the wiles of lady bears too."

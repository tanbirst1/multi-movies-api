    "synopsis": "Arthur and his two children, Kathy and Bobby, inherit his Uncle Cyrus\u2019s estate: a glass house that serves as a prison to 12 ghosts. When the family, accompanied by Bobby\u2019s Nanny and an attorney, enter the house they find themselves trapped inside an evil machine \u201cdesigned by the devil and powered by the dead\u201d to open the Eye of Hell. Aided by Dennis, a ghost hunter, and his rival Kalina, a ghost rights activist out to set the ghosts free, the group must do what they can to get out of the house alive."

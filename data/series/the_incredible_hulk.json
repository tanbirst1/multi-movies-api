    "synopsis": "The Incredible Hulk is an American animated television series starring the Marvel Comics character the Hulk. It ran two seasons, for 21 episodes, on the television network UPN from 1996 to 1997. Lou Ferrigno, who portrayed Universal\u2019s version of the Hulk on the 1970s live-action TV series, provided the Hulk\u2019s voice for the true version from Marvel.The show often featured cameo appearances by characters from other Marvel cartoons of the period. In the second season, the show\u2019s format, after UPN decided that Season 1 was too dark, was changed, and to give \u201cfemale viewers a chance\u201d, the network ordered that She-Hulk be made a regular co-star. As a result, the series was officially renamed The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk. The second season also featured the Grey Hulk.",
